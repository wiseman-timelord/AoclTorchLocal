# AoclTorchLocal
Status: Alpha. Do not use, under heavy development.

### Description
Amd Gpu is Rocm only, and Directml is Onnx, so the solution is: enhance Avx2 with special Aocl code. Users obviously require Aocl to be installed, its driver updates or someth for Amd processors, but its significantly faster.
